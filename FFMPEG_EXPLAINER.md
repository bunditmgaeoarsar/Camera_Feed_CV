# FFmpeg Command Explained

This document breaks down the `ffmpeg` command used in the `convert_http_to_rtsp.sh` script. The primary goal of this command is to convert a potentially unstable, low-quality MJPEG stream into a stable, efficient, and widely compatible H.264 RTSP stream, suitable for computer vision tasks.

## The Command

```bash
ffmpeg -fflags +genpts -use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1 -re \
  -i "$INPUT_URL" \
  -vf "fps=10,format=yuv420p,scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2" \
  -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency \
  -pix_fmt yuv420p -b:v 800k -maxrate 800k -bufsize 1600k \
  -rtsp_transport tcp \
  -f rtsp "$OUTPUT_URL"
```

### Input Stream Handling

These flags help `ffmpeg` correctly interpret the incoming live stream.

-   **`-fflags +genpts`**: This flag instructs `ffmpeg` to generate Presentation Timestamps (PTS) for the incoming frames. This is crucial for streams that might have missing or incorrect timestamps, a common issue with simple IP cameras.

-   **`-use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1`**: This works in conjunction with the previous flag. It tells `ffmpeg` to use the system's "wall clock" time to generate the timestamps. This helps create a smooth, continuous output stream, even if the source stream is choppy or irregular.

-   **`-re`**: This flag tells `ffmpeg` to read the input at its native frame rate. Without this, `ffmpeg` would try to read the input stream as fast as possible, which would quickly overwhelm the buffer and cause issues for a live feed.

-   **`-i "$INPUT_URL"`**: This specifies the input source, which is the HTTP MJPEG stream from the camera.

### Video Filtering (`-vf`)

The `-vf` (video filter) flag applies a chain of filters to process the raw video frames.

-   **`fps=10`**: This sets the output frame rate to 10 frames per second. This is a common practice to reduce CPU load and network bandwidth, as high frame rates are often unnecessary for surveillance or basic computer vision analysis.

-   **`format=yuv420p`**: This sets the pixel format to `yuv420p`. This is the most compatible color space for H.264 video and is a requirement for many video players and libraries.

-   **`scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2`**: This is a clever filter to ensure the video's width and height are even numbers (e.g., 640x480, not 639x479). The H.264 codec requires that both dimensions be divisible by 2. This command takes the input width (`iw`) and height (`ih`), divides each by 2, truncates any decimal part, and then multiplies by 2, guaranteeing an even number.

### Video Encoding

This section configures the `libx264` (H.264) video encoder for real-time performance.

-   **`-c:v libx264`**: This specifies that the video codec for the output stream is `libx264`, a very popular and efficient open-source H.264 encoder.

-   **`-preset ultrafast`**: This tells `libx264` to use the fastest possible encoding settings. This is critical for real-time streaming as it minimizes the delay (latency) between the input and output. The trade-off is slightly lower quality for the same bitrate, but for this use case, low latency is the priority.

-   **`-tune zerolatency`**: This further optimizes the encoder for real-time streaming by disabling features that can introduce delays, such as frame lookahead.

-   **`-pix_fmt yuv420p`**: This is set again in the output options to ensure the final output stream has the correct pixel format.

-   **`-b:v 800k`**: This sets the target video bitrate to 800 kilobits per second. This is a reasonable bitrate for a standard-definition stream at 10 fps.

-   **`-maxrate 800k -bufsize 1600k`**: These flags work together to control the bitrate. `-maxrate` sets the maximum allowed bitrate, and `-bufsize` sets the size of the buffer that the encoder uses to manage the bitrate. A common rule of thumb is to set the buffer size to be twice the max rate to handle fluctuations in stream complexity.

### Output Stream Handling

These final flags configure the output container and protocol.

-   **`-rtsp_transport tcp`**: This forces `ffmpeg` to use TCP for the outgoing RTSP stream. While RTSP can also use UDP, TCP is generally more reliable as it guarantees packet delivery, which is important for avoiding visual artifacts, especially on networks with potential packet loss.

-   **`-f rtsp`**: This tells `ffmpeg` that the output container format is RTSP.

-   **`"$OUTPUT_URL"`**: This is the final destination URL for the newly created RTSP stream, which will be something like `rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/camera1`.
